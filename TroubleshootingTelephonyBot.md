# Troubleshooting Telephony Bot

Having issues getting your bot to be chatty? Try the suggestions below.

## Call connects but bot never says anything

This indicates that the telephony service is picking up, but having trouble sending messages to your bot.

### Using SSML? Make sure to use the full name of the voice font

Currently [SSML](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-synthesis-markup) voice fonts need to be specified using their full name.

```csharp
protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    //Wait for the user to say something :)
    if(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(turnContext.Activity.Text)) {
        return;
    }

    //Echo what they say!
    var replyText = $"You said {turnContext.Activity.Text}";

    //Doesn't work
    //var ssmlText = $"<speak version='1.0' xmlns='https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xml:lang='en-US'><voice name='Jessa24kRUS'>{replyText}</voice></speak>");

    //Works
    var ssmlText = $"<speak version='1.0' xmlns='https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xml:lang='en-US'><voice name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Jessa24kRUS)'>{replyText}</voice></speak>");
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Text(replyText, ssmlText), cancellationToken);
}
```

Validate that your speech account is in a region that supports the voice you are attempting to use. [Regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/regions#standard-and-neural-voices)

## Getting an error when binding a cognitive services key to a number. 

![](images/channelConfigurationError.png)

Cognitive service keys map to bots 1:1. This means that if a bot has a cognitive services key, no other bot can use the same key, and vice versa.
A phone number can only be associated with a single bot.

Violating either of the above conditions will result in an error on configuration of the channel.

## Transfer / handoff to another number failing 

If you are unable to successfully handoff / transfer to another number, confirm that your ACS number is enabled for Outbound Calling via the Azure portal.  If it is, try disabling outbound calling, saving and then enabling it again.
