# Create a Bot

In this step, we will create a new bot in Azure that we could then link to a phone number. There are two ways to create a bot using Microsoft Bot Framework: using Azure Bot Service or Bot Framework Composer.

## Create a bot using Bot Framework Composer

[Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/introduction) is a visual authoring tool for building bots. We recommend it for users who want to design complex dialogs using a visual interface. Follow instructions to create a Composer bot [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/quickstart-create-bot) and publish it to Azure as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/how-to-publish-bot).

## Create a bot using Azure Bot Service

Not ready to use the Composer? Create a bot using Azure Bot Service by clicking [here](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.BotServiceSdkGalleryPackage). Additional instructions on how to create and configure the bot as well as download the source code are available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0). It is recommended to [test your bot in Web Chat](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/abs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0#test-the-bot) before proceeding to next steps.
